# react-paging-toolkit
Easy component based paging

# This is NOT a finished solution, but an experiment in progress. The aim of this project is to allow me to implement a uniform flexible paging style across all projects that I work on. I highly advise that if you want to use this library that you fix the version as to not suffer from breaking changes!
